  general: [
    { question: "Which is the best MBA college in Pune?", answer: "Symbiosis Institute of Business Management (SIBM Pune) is the #1 MBA college in Pune with NIRF rank 14 and average placement of ₹24 LPA. SCMHRD (NIRF #22, avg ₹19 LPA) and PUMBA (government, ₹1.25L/yr fees) are close runners-up. For budget-conscious students, PUMBA offers exceptional value." },
    { question: "What is the MBA fee in Pune?", answer: "MBA fees in Pune range from ₹1.25L/year at PUMBA (government) to ₹16L/year at FLAME University. Mid-tier MBA colleges charge ₹3.5L–7L/year. Total 2-year MBA cost: ₹2.5L (PUMBA) to ₹32L (FLAME/SIBM). Most MAH-CET MBA colleges fall in the ₹3L–10L total range." },
    { question: "Which entrance exam is needed for MBA in Pune?", answer: "MAH-CET MBA is the primary entrance exam for most MBA colleges in Pune via the DTE Maharashtra CAP process. SNAP is required for Symbiosis colleges (SIBM, SCMHRD). CAT, CMAT, MAT, ATMA, and XAT are also accepted at various Pune MBA colleges. Some colleges accept multiple exams." },
    { question: "What is the average salary after MBA from Pune?", answer: "Average MBA placement package in Pune ranges from ₹7 LPA (tier-2 colleges) to ₹24 LPA (SIBM Pune). Mid-tier MBA colleges like MIT-SOM offer ₹10–12 LPA average, while SCMHRD offers ₹19 LPA. Specializations in Finance and Analytics command a 20-30% premium over average packages." },
    { question: "Is MBA from Pune University valid?", answer: "Yes, PUMBA (Pune University MBA / Department of Management Sciences, SPPU) is a fully recognized, government-run MBA program affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University. It is AICTE-approved and has NAAC A+ grade. PUMBA MBA degree is equivalent to any private MBA and accepted by all employers and higher education institutions." },
    { question: "How many MBA colleges are there in Pune?", answer: "Pune has 120+ AICTE-approved MBA colleges across government, autonomous, deemed university, and private categories. This includes 5 Symbiosis group colleges, 15+ SPPU-affiliated colleges, 30+ autonomous MBA institutes, and 70+ private unaided MBA colleges." },
    { question: "Is Pune good for MBA?", answer: "Yes, Pune is one of India's top 5 cities for MBA education. It offers the best industry-academia interface with 1,000+ companies for placements, top-ranked colleges like SIBM and SCMHRD, and the most affordable government MBA option (PUMBA at ₹1.25L/yr). The city's IT, manufacturing, BFSI, and pharma sectors offer diverse MBA placement opportunities." },
    { question: "What is the minimum CAT score for MBA in Pune?", answer: "There is no single minimum. CAT percentiles change every year, and each programme sets its own shortlisting criteria. Symbiosis MBA programmes (SIBM, SCMHRD) admit through SNAP, not CAT. CAT is accepted for All-India seats in Maharashtra's MBA CAP and by programmes such as MIT-WPU's MBA. Check each programme's current admission page — see /mba-colleges-in-pune-accepting-cat for verified programmes." },

    { question: "Which is the cheapest MBA college in Pune?", answer: "PUMBA (Pune University MBA) at Savitribai Phule Pune University is the cheapest quality MBA college in Pune at ₹1.25L/year (₹2.5L total). For private colleges, Indira Institute of Management (₹4.5L total) and BVIMR (₹7L total) offer the best value-for-money among AICTE-approved programs." },
    { question: "Are there any MBA colleges in Pune under 5 lakh total fees?", answer: "Yes. PUMBA (₹2.5L total), government-aided SPPU MBA colleges (₹2L–4L total), and some autonomous private colleges offer MBA under 5 lakh total. These seats are filled via MAH-CET MBA CAP rounds. Merit matters — PUMBA cutoff is 95+ percentile." },
