  {
    question: "Is management quota admission legal in Pune engineering colleges?",
    answer:
      "Yes, management quota admission is completely legal. It is regulated by AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) and DTE Maharashtra (Directorate of Technical Education). Private and deemed universities are permitted to fill up to 15–30% of their seats through institute-level (management quota) admissions. Fees are capped and approved by the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA) of Maharashtra.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does COEP have management quota seats?",
    answer:
      "No. College of Engineering Pune (COEP) is a government autonomous institute and does NOT offer management quota seats. 100% of its seats are filled through CAP (Centralized Admission Process) rounds conducted by DTE Maharashtra via MHT-CET or JEE Main scores.",
  },
  {
    question: "What documents are required for direct admission in Pune engineering college?",
    answer:
      "For management quota direct admission you need: Class 12 marksheet and passing certificate, Class 10 marksheet, Photo ID (Aadhar card), passport size photographs (6–8), migration certificate, gap certificate (if applicable), domicile certificate (for Maharashtra quota), and an MHT-CET scorecard (though rank may not be mandatory for MQ seats).",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does management quota cost compared to regular seats?",
    answer:
      "Management quota fees are typically 1.5x to 2.5x higher than regular CAP round fees. For example, VIT Pune regular fees are ₹1.6L–₹2.2L/year while management quota fees are ₹2.5L–₹3.5L/year. SIT Pune regular fees are ₹3.6L–₹4.8L/year vs management quota ₹5L–₹6L/year. Total extra cost over 4 years can range from ₹3L to ₹8L.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get direct BTech admission in Pune without any entrance exam?",
    answer:
      "Through the management quota route, some private and deemed colleges in Pune may consider direct admission primarily based on Class 12 PCM percentage without requiring an entrance exam score. However, at least 45–50% marks in 12th PCM are required. JSPM, AISSMS, and some other private colleges have the most flexible criteria for management quota.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the NRI quota in Pune engineering colleges?",
    answer:
      "NRI (Non-Resident Indian) quota is typically 5–15% of seats reserved for NRI students or those sponsored by NRI relatives. Fees are charged in USD and are significantly higher (often $4,000–$8,000/year). Deemed universities like MIT-WPU, SIT Pune, and Symbiosis institutions are popular for NRI quota admissions. You need a valid NRI/OCI status and sponsorship letter.",
  },
  {
    question: "When does management quota admission process start in Pune?",
    answer:
      "Management quota admission typically begins after CAP Round 1 or Round 2 results (usually July–August). Colleges open their institute-level admission windows after DTE releases the CAP schedule. For 2026, the process is expected to start in August 2026. Contact individual college admission offices directly starting June 2026 to register your interest early.",
