It has 800+ affiliated colleges in Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, and Kolhapur districts. Top SPPU colleges in Pune: COEP (NIRF #49), VIT Pune (NIRF #101), PICT, Fergusson College, SP College, JSPM RSCOE." },
  { question: "Is COEP affiliated to SPPU?", answer: "COEP Technological University was formerly affiliated to SPPU but is now an autonomous deemed-to-be university (COEP-TU) under the Government of Maharashtra. Similarly, VIT Pune, PICT, and Fergusson College are 'autonomous' under SPPU, meaning they design their own curriculum but degrees are awarded by SPPU." },

For BCom, Garware College is top-ranked. All these hold NAAC A or A+ accreditation." },
  { question: "How to apply for SPPU affiliated colleges in Pune 2026?", answer: "SPPU engineering college admissions are through MHT-CET CAP rounds via DTE Maharashtra (July 2026). For Arts/Science/Commerce, apply directly to the college (merit-based, June–July 2026). For MBA, MAH-MBA-CET or CAT scores are used (CAP counselling in September 2026). All applications are online." },
