  { q: "What is MHT-CET and which Pune colleges accept it?", a: "MHT-CET (Maharashtra Common Entrance Test) is conducted by Maharashtra State Common Entrance Test Cell. Almost all 50+ engineering colleges in Pune accept MHT-CET for state quota seats. Government engineering colleges like COEP exclusively use MHT-CET/JEE for admissions." },
  { q: "What MHT-CET percentile is needed for COEP Pune?", a: "COEP Computer Engineering requires 99.5+ percentile in MHT-CET. COEP Mechanical/Electronics requires 90-95 percentile. These cutoffs are for Open (General) category. OBC: 5-8 percentile relaxation. SC/ST: 15-20 percentile relaxation." },
  { q: "What is the CAP (Centralized Admission Process) for MHT-CET?", a: "CAP is the merit-based seat allotment process conducted by MHT-CET Cell in 3 rounds (July-August). Students register on cetcell.mahacet.org, fill college preferences, and seats are allotted based on percentile and category. No direct admission in government/aided colleges - only through CAP." },
  { q: "Can I use MHT-CET score for MBA admission in Pune?", a: "Yes. MAH-MBA-CET (different from PCM-based MHT-CET) is the MBA entrance test for CAP in Maharashtra. Score required for SIBM/SCMHRD via MAH-CET: 99+ percentile. For mid-tier MBA colleges: 80-90 percentile. Apply at cetcell.mahacet.org for MBA CAP." },
  { q: "What happens if I don't get allotted in CAP Round 1?", a: "If Round 1 does not allot your preferred college, you can freeze (accept current allotment), float (upgrade if better seat opens in Round 2), or slide (upgrade only within same college). Round 2 and Round 3 fill remaining seats. After all rounds, vacant seats go for direct admission at colleges." },

          "MHT-CET (Maharashtra Common Entrance Test) is the gateway to engineering admissions in Pune for Maharashtra residents. Conducted by Maharashtra State Common Entrance Test Cell, MHT-CET PCM tests Class 11 and 12 content in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. The exam is conducted in April-May 2026 and results determine eligibility for 50+ engineering colleges in Pune via the Centralized Admission Process (CAP).",
          "The CAP (Centralized Admission Process) is Pune's seat allotment mechanism - a transparent, online merit-based system where students fill college preferences in priority order and seats are allotted based on percentile rank within category. Three rounds of allotment happen in July-August, with options to Freeze (keep current seat), Float (upgrade to better seat if available), or Slide (upgrade within same college).",
          "MHT-CET cutoffs vary dramatically across branches and colleges. Computer Engineering is the most competitive branch at top colleges. Mechanical, Civil, and Chemical Engineering branches have lower cutoffs at the same colleges. Understanding category-wise cutoffs (Open, OBC, SC, ST, EWS) is crucial for planning your college preferences in CAP rounds.",
