  { q: "What is the fee for MBBS in Pune?", a: "Government MBBS (BJMC) costs ₹1-2L/year (₹5-10L total). AFMC is fully sponsored by the Army. Private MBBS colleges charge ₹8-22L/year (₹40L-1.5Cr total for 5.5 years). Government-aided private colleges offer some subsidized seats via MCC/State Quota." },
  { q: "How many MBBS seats are there in Pune government colleges?", a: "BJ Government Medical College has 150 MBBS seats per year. 85 seats are under All India Quota (MCC), remaining 65 under State Quota (Maharashtra DMER).

  { q: "What is the duration of MBBS in Pune?", a: "MBBS is a 5.5-year program (4.5 years academic + 1 year compulsory rotating internship).

These institutions are supplemented by several private medical colleges under deemed universities, offering 1,500+ MBBS seats annually.",
          "MBBS admission in Pune is entirely NEET-based. The National Medical Commission (NMC) mandates NEET scores for all MBBS admissions. 15% of seats in government colleges go through All India Quota (controlled by MCC, New Delhi), while 85% go through State Quota (controlled by Maharashtra DMER, Mumbai). Private colleges split seats into Government Quota, Management Quota, and NRI Quota.",
          "The fee structure for MBBS in Pune varies dramatically: BJ Government Medical College charges just ₹1-2L/year for government quota seats, while private medical colleges like DY Patil Pimpri charge ₹18-22L/year for management quota seats. AFMC is unique - the Army fully sponsors MBBS with stipend, in exchange for 7 years of Army medical service commitment.",
