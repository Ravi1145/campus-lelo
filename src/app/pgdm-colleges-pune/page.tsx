const faqs = [
  { q: "What is the difference between PGDM and MBA in Pune?", a: "An MBA is a degree awarded by a university (for example, Savitribai Phule Pune University or a deemed university such as Symbiosis), while a PGDM is a diploma from an AICTE-approved autonomous institute. A PGDM is not automatically equivalent to an MBA — the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) grants equivalence to specific PGDM programmes for higher studies, for a fixed period. Compare individual programmes rather than the label." },
  { q: "Is PGDM from Pune colleges recognized?", a: "A PGDM is recognised when the institute holds current AICTE approval for that programme and intake. For higher studies or jobs that ask for an \"MBA or equivalent\", check whether the programme currently holds AIU equivalence. Note that SCMHRD and other Symbiosis institutes award an MBA degree through Symbiosis International University, not a PGDM." },
  { q: "What is the eligibility for PGDM admission in Pune?", a: "Minimum 50% in graduation (45% for SC/ST) from any recognized university. Must appear in CAT, MAH-CET, XAT, SNAP, or other accepted exams. Work experience is not mandatory but is preferred by top institutes like SCMHRD." },
  { q: "What is the average fee for PGDM in Pune?", a: "PGDM fees in Pune range from ₹3.8L (Suryadatta) to ₹12L (FLAME University) for 2 years. Mid-tier institutes charge ₹4-6L. Premium institutes like SCMHRD and MIT-SOB charge ₹6-8L. These fees include tuition but may exclude hostel and study materials." },
  { q: "Which PGDM specializations are available in Pune?", a: "Popular PGDM specializations in Pune: Finance, Marketing, Human Resource Management, Operations Management, Business Analytics, International Business, Supply Chain Management, and Entrepreneurship. Finance and Marketing are the most popular for high-paying careers." },

          "PGDM (Post Graduate Diploma in Management) is a 2-year management program offered by AICTE-approved autonomous institutes in Pune. Unlike university-affiliated MBA programs, PGDM institutes have more flexibility to update curricula, making them often more industry-relevant. Top PGDM institutes in Pune like SCMHRD have placement records rivaling IIMs in certain specializations.",
          "The key advantage of PGDM over MBA is industry orientation. PGDM programs in Pune frequently invite guest faculty from corporate leaders, incorporate live case studies from Pune's business ecosystem, and structure internships with specific industry partners. This real-world immersion results in higher starting salaries and better career transitions for graduates.",
          "For 2026 PGDM admissions, candidates need to appear for CAT (November 2025), MAH-CET (March 2026), SNAP (December 2025 for Symbiosis), or XAT (January 2026). Most PGDM institutes in Pune accept multiple exam scores. Work experience, while not mandatory, significantly strengthens applications to top institutes like SCMHRD.",
