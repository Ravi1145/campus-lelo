          "Pune's BTech colleges under ₹10 lakh total fees include COEP (NIRF #49), PICT (best CS in Pune), VIT Pune (NAAC A+, NIRF 101), PCCOE (NAAC A+), and DYPCOE — all delivering ₹7–12 LPA average placements. This is an extraordinary combination of quality and affordability rare in Indian engineering education.",
          "The ROI math is compelling. VIT Pune at ₹8.8L maximum total fees delivers ₹8.5 LPA average placement — your investment pays back in under 13 months of working. PICT at ₹7.6L maximum with ₹7.5 LPA average pays back in 12 months. Compare this to paying ₹15–19L for SIT Pune or MIT-WPU with similar placement outcomes.",
          "The secret is simple: autonomous SPPU-affiliated colleges receive government grants that reduce fees without compromising academic quality. Their autonomy allows curriculum innovation while SPPU affiliation ensures national recognition. This is why PICT, VIT Pune, and PCCOE consistently outperform many more expensive private colleges in placement outcomes.",
