    question: "Which is the cheapest engineering college in Pune?",
    answer:
      "College of Engineering Pune (COEP) is the cheapest engineering college in Pune with fees of ₹80,000–₹1.8L per year (government college). Among private colleges, Indira College of Engineering & Management charges ₹95K–₹1.35L/yr making it the most affordable private option. Total 4-year cost at COEP is approximately ₹4–7 lakh including all fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I do B.Tech in Pune under 5 lakh total fees?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can complete B.Tech in Pune under ₹5 lakh total fees at government college COEP (if you get in early and avail scholarships). Indira College of Engineering has total fees starting from ₹3.8L for 4 years. SC/ST students can get full fee waivers at government colleges, making B.Tech nearly free. EBC (Economically Backward Class) students also get substantial fee concessions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cheapest private engineering college in Pune?",
    answer:
      "Indira College of Engineering & Management (ICEM) at Pune is the cheapest private engineering college with fees of ₹95,000–₹1.35L per year (total ₹3.8–5.4L for 4 years). AISSMS College of Engineering charges ₹1.1L–₹1.55L/yr and is another very affordable option. Both are NAAC accredited and affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU).",
  },
  {
    question: "Which engineering colleges in Pune have fees under ₹10 lakh total?",
    answer:
      "Several Pune engineering colleges have total 4-year B.Tech fees under ₹10 lakh: COEP (₹4–7L), Indira College (₹3.8–5.4L), AISSMS (₹4.4–6.2L), Sinhgad College (₹4.6–6.4L), JSPM RSCOE (₹4.8–6.8L), PICT (₹5.6–7.6L), and VIT Pune (₹6.4–8.8L). All except SIT Pune and MIT-WPU fall under the ₹10L mark.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the fee structure for government engineering colleges in Pune?",
    answer:
      "Government engineering colleges in Pune like COEP have a fee structure that includes: Tuition fees (₹40,000–₹80,000/yr), development fees (₹20,000–₹40,000/yr), examination fees (₹5,000–₹10,000/yr), and other charges. Total annual fees at COEP range from ₹80,000 to ₹1.8L depending on branch. Maharashtra government regulates fees for government and government-aided colleges.",
  },
  {
    question: "How to reduce engineering college fees in Pune?",
    answer:
      "You can reduce engineering college fees through: (1) EBC quota: Economically Backward Class students with family income below ₹8L/year get 50% fee concession. (2) SC/ST fee waiver, full tuition fee waiver for students from Scheduled Caste/Tribe. (3) OBC fee reduction, students from Other Backward Classes get 25–50% fee reduction. (4) Merit scholarships: top-ranking students get merit-based scholarships. (5) AICTE scholarship: ₹30,000/year for eligible students. (6) NSP (National Scholarship Portal) scholarships.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is COEP really cheaper than private colleges in Pune?",
    answer:
      "Yes, COEP (College of Engineering Pune) is significantly cheaper than private colleges. COEP charges ₹80,000–₹1.8L/year as a government institution. In comparison, private autonomous colleges charge ₹1.4L–₹2.2L/year and deemed universities charge ₹2L–₹4.8L/year. However, COEP requires 95+ percentile in MHT-CET which makes admission very competitive. If you cannot qualify for COEP, AISSMS and Indira College offer the next best affordable options.",
