  { question: "Can I get MBA admission in Pune without MAH-CET?", answer: "Yes. MBA direct admission in Pune is possible through: (1) Management Quota seats (15-20% of intake) at private colleges — no MAH-CET required. (2) Institutional Quota at deemed universities (MIT-WPU, DYPIM) via direct application. (3) NRI/NRI-sponsored quota. (4) Spot admission rounds after CAP for vacant seats at lower-cutoff colleges." },
  { question: "What is the process for MBA direct admission in Pune?", answer: "MBA direct admission process in Pune: (1) Contact the college admission office directly. (2) Submit your graduation certificate, 10+2 marksheets, and any entrance score (optional). (3) Attend an interview (most colleges conduct GD-PI even for direct admission). (4) Pay the management quota fee (typically 1.5-2× regular fees). (5) Complete document verification and enrollment." },
  { question: "What are the fees for MBA direct/management quota in Pune?", answer: "MBA management quota fees in Pune are typically 1.5–2× the CAP (regular) fees. Examples: MIT-SOM CAP fees ₹7L (2yr), management quota ₹10–12L (2yr). DYPIM CAP ₹12L, management quota ₹15–18L. Management quota is usually not eligible for government scholarships." },
  { question: "Is MBA direct admission valid and recognized?", answer: "Yes. MBA direct admission through management quota is 100% valid and the degree is identical to CAP-allotted seats. Both CAP and management quota students attend the same classes, sit the same exams, and receive the same university degree. There is no academic difference." },

          "MBA direct admission (management quota) is a legitimate, AICTE-recognized route for students who want to join Pune MBA colleges without competing in MAH-CET, CAT, or other entrance exams. All private and deemed university MBA colleges in Pune reserve 15-20% of their total intake for management/institutional quota.",
          "Direct admission at private Pune MBA colleges typically requires: graduation with 50% marks, a brief interview or GD-PI at the college, and payment of the management quota fees. Some colleges also conduct their own aptitude test for management quota shortlisting.",
          "Key advantage of direct admission: you can target the college you want regardless of MAH-CET score. Key disadvantage: you pay 1.5–2× higher fees and are not eligible for government EBC/scholarship programs. Calculate ROI carefully — if placement outcomes are the same, the higher fee may be justified.",
