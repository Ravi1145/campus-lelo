  { question: "What is the MHT-CET cutoff for COEP Pune 2026?", answer: "COEP MHT-CET 2026 cutoff (expected, Open category): Computer Engineering: 99.5+ percentile, Mechanical: 97+, Civil: 94+, Electronics: 96+. These are closing percentiles from Round 1. Cutoffs drop 1–3 percentile in subsequent rounds. Reserved category cutoffs are 15–25 percentile lower." },
  { question: "Which Pune BTech colleges accept MHT-CET for admission?", answer: "All 50+ SPPU-affiliated engineering colleges in Pune accept MHT-CET through DTE Maharashtra's CAP process. This includes COEP, PICT, VIT Pune, MIT-WPU (also own test), SIT Pune (also SET), PCCOE, DYPCOE, AISSMS, Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sinhgad group, JSPM group, and all government-aided and private unaided engineering colleges." },
  { question: "How are BTech seats allocated through MHT-CET CAP in Pune?", answer: "DTE Maharashtra's CAP (Centralized Admission Process) allots BTech seats based on MHT-CET percentile, category, domicile, and college-branch preferences filled by the student. Three CAP rounds are conducted (July–August). Cutoffs are determined by the lowest percentile admitted in each round. Students can float to higher-preference allotments in subsequent rounds." },
  { question: "What is the MHT-CET pattern for BTech 2026?", answer: "MHT-CET PCM (for BTech) 2026 pattern: 150 questions, 180 minutes. Physics: 50 questions (100 marks), Chemistry: 50 questions (100 marks), Mathematics: 50 questions (200 marks — 4 marks each). Difficulty level: 60% NCERT, 40% Maharashtra state board. No negative marking." },
  { question: "Can I improve my MHT-CET seat in later CAP rounds?", answer: "Yes. If you get a seat in CAP Round 1 but were allotted a lower-preference college/branch, you can participate in Round 2 and 3 with your original preferences intact. This is called 'floating.' In Round 2 and 3, if a better preference opens up, you'll be upgraded. Your Round 1 seat is cancelled only if you get a better allotment." },

You register, submit documents, fill up to 300 college-branch preferences, and receive allotments in 3 rounds. The entire process is transparent and merit-based with category-wise reservations.",
          "Key CAP strategy: Fill your option form carefully. Place COEP CS or PICT CS first if you score 97+ percentile. For 85–95 percentile, target VIT Pune, PCCOE, MIT-WPU. For 70–84 percentile, DYPCOE, AISSMS, and other SPPU colleges are realistic. Always fill 15–20 options, not just 5.",
