  { question: "How to get direct BTech admission in Pune without MHT-CET?", answer: "Direct BTech admission in Pune without MHT-CET is available through: (1) Management quota (15% of seats) at private engineering colleges — apply directly to the college. (2) NRI/NRI-sponsored quota. (3) Direct admission at deemed universities (MIT-WPU, SIT) through their own entrance test (no MHT-CET required). (4) Spot admission rounds after CAP for vacant seats." },
  { question: "What are the management quota BTech fees in Pune?", answer: "Management quota BTech fees in Pune are typically 1.5–2× the regular CAP fees. Examples: VIT Pune CAP ₹1.6L/yr, management quota ₹2.5–3L/yr. MIT-WPU direct: ₹3L–4.5L/yr. PCCOE management: ₹2–2.8L/yr. Note: COEP is a government college — no management quota available." },
  { question: "Is BTech direct admission valid and AICTE approved?", answer: "Yes. BTech management quota admission is 100% AICTE-approved and valid. The degree is identical to merit/CAP seats — same faculty, same exams, same university degree. Management quota students attend all the same classes and get the same SPPU/deemed university BTech certificate." },
  { question: "What documents are needed for BTech direct admission in Pune?", answer: "Documents for BTech direct admission in Pune: 12th (HSC) marksheet with PCM subjects and minimum 50% marks, 10th marksheet, Aadhar card, category certificate (if applicable), domicile certificate, passport photos, allotment refusal letter (if previously allotted in CAP but want direct at better college), and management quota fee payment." },
  { question: "Can I get direct BTech admission in COEP or PICT Pune?", answer: "COEP is a government autonomous college — no management quota. Direct admission not possible at COEP. PICT is an aided autonomous college — very limited management quota, if any. Direct admission is primarily at private unaided and deemed universities: MIT-WPU, SIT Pune, PCCOE, VIT Pune, DYPCOE, AISSMS, and Sinhgad group colleges." },
