  { question: "Can I get BTech admission in Pune without JEE Main?", answer: "Yes, absolutely. BTech admission in Pune does NOT require JEE Main. The primary entrance exam for Pune BTech colleges is MHT-CET (Maharashtra Common Entrance Test). All 50+ engineering colleges in Pune accept MHT-CET for CAP (state quota) seats. JEE Main is only required for management quota seats at some colleges or for IITs/NITs." },
  { question: "Is JEE required for COEP Pune?", answer: "JEE Main is NOT required for COEP's MHT-CET CAP seats (which are the majority of seats). COEP accepts MHT-CET scores for the DTE Maharashtra CAP process. JEE Advanced is accepted for a small number of seats under a special scheme. Most COEP students get in through MHT-CET — JEE is not needed." },
  { question: "Which BTech colleges in Pune accept MHT-CET without JEE?", answer: "All 50+ BTech colleges in Pune accept MHT-CET without JEE Main: COEP, PICT, VIT Pune, MIT-WPU, SIT Pune, PCCOE, DYPCOE, AISSMS, Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sinhgad group, JSPM group, and all SPPU-affiliated engineering colleges. JEE Main is an additional option, not a requirement." },
  { question: "What is the difference between MHT-CET and JEE for Pune BTech?", answer: "MHT-CET is a Maharashtra state exam (60% NCERT + 40% Maharashtra state board syllabus) that controls 90%+ of BTech seats in Pune. JEE Main is a national exam used for IITs/NITs and as an alternative for management quota. For Pune specifically, MHT-CET is the primary and more important exam — most top students at COEP and PICT got in through MHT-CET." },
  { question: "What MHT-CET score is needed for BTech in Pune without JEE?", answer: "MHT-CET cutoffs for Pune BTech without JEE: COEP (CS): 99+ percentile, PICT (CS): 97–99 percentile, VIT Pune: 92–97 percentile, PCCOE: 85–93 percentile, MIT-WPU: 82–90 percentile, DYPCOE/AISSMS: 68–82 percentile. You don't need JEE for any of these colleges." },

Students from any state board (not just Maharashtra) can appear — but domicile certificate matters for reservations in Maharashtra colleges.",
