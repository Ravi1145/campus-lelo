For budget-conscious engineering students, state-quota seats at private colleges via MHT-CET also offer subsidized fees under government regulation.",

In addition to inherently low fees at government colleges, Maharashtra's scholarship ecosystem -- including EBC scholarships, OBC scholarships, and NSP (National Scholarship Portal) schemes -- can reduce effective fees to near-zero for eligible students at any NAAC-accredited institution.",
