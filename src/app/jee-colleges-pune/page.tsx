const faqs = [
  { q: "Which Pune engineering colleges accept JEE Main?", a: "Most Pune engineering colleges accept JEE Main: COEP (state quota), SIT Pune, MIT-WPU, VIT Pune, PICT, Bharati Vidyapeeth, and Cummins College. JEE scores are used for management quota seats and some all-India quota seats at government-aided colleges." },
  { q: "What JEE Main percentile is needed for COEP Pune?", a: "COEP's All India Quota seats require JEE Main 95+ percentile for Computer Engineering. For Mechanical and Electronics at COEP, 85-90 percentile suffices. COEP state quota seats are allotted via MHT-CET CAP, not directly through JEE." },
  { q: "Is JEE Main required for admission in Pune?", a: "No. MHT-CET is the primary exam for Pune engineering colleges. JEE Main is an alternative accepted at many private colleges. Government college state quota seats exclusively use MHT-CET. JEE is required for All India Quota (AIQ) seats at COEP and for direct admission at deemed universities." },
  { q: "What JEE score is needed for SIT Pune (Symbiosis)?", a: "SIT Pune (Symbiosis Institute of Technology) accepts JEE Main 75+ percentile for most branches and 85+ for CS Engineering. They also conduct their own SET (Symbiosis Entrance Test). JEE Main is not mandatory - SET scores alone can qualify you for admission." },
  { q: "Can Out-of-State students use JEE Main for Pune college admission?", a: "Yes. Out-of-Maharashtra students can use JEE Main for management quota seats at private Pune engineering colleges. For state quota seats in government colleges, Maharashtra domicile is required. Deemed universities (SIT, MIT-WPU) welcome students from all states via JEE/SET." },

While MHT-CET is the primary route for Maharashtra state quota seats, JEE Main opens additional pathways - especially for students from outside Maharashtra or those seeking premium deemed university seats.",
          "For 2026, JEE Main will be conducted in two sessions: January and April. The best of two session scores is used for admission. NTA (National Testing Agency) conducts JEE Main, and scores are accepted by COEP (AIQ seats), SIT Pune, MIT-WPU, Bharati Vidyapeeth, and many other Pune engineering colleges.",
          "A strategic advantage of strong JEE Main performance is access to management quota seats at autonomous colleges and deemed universities, bypassing the MHT-CET CAP queue. Students who did not perform well in MHT-CET can use JEE Main scores to secure admissions at VIT Pune, MIT-WPU, or SIT Pune directly through college-level admissions.",
